# Cuefinger 1.x

With Cuefinger you can remote control Universal Audio's Console Application via LAN/Wifi.

In a recording studio this gives the studio musician the possibility to access the cue mix via a linux, android or windows tablet/phone. As an example, you could use an UA Apollo interface with 4 cue busses in combination with 4 tablets/phones allowing 4 musicians to control their cue mix individually.
Features:

- Volume, Pan, Mute, Solo, Pre/Post of the Monitor, the CUE- and AUX-Mixes
- Responsive design allows mixing also on tiny screens
- Show only the channels you need via select channels
- Reorder channels
- Mix groups
- Color coding
- Lock to mix (e.g. allow access only to CUE 1)
- Mute All button
- Easily switch between servers
- Low on CPU usage and uses GPU acceleration

I use cuefinger in my studio since a few years now. Until now I couldn't find the time to publish it for others to use, but better late than never.
Cuefinger runs in my studio on 3 low budget HP Stream 7 tablets with Linux Mint and I also use an old win10 tablet (32bit). They remotely control my cascaded Apollo Silver and Apollo 16 black. I also tested it with Apollo Solo. There is no iOS Version since I have no experience in writing for this platform.
