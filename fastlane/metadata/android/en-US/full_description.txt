With Cuefinger you can remote control Universal Audio's Console Application via LAN/Wifi.

In a recording studio this gives the studio musician the possibility to access the cue mix via a linux, android or windows tablet/phone. As an example, you could use an UA Apollo interface with 4 cue busses in combination with 4 tablets/phones allowing 4 musicians to control their cue mix individually.
